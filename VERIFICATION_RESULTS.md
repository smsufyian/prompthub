# Git Hook Verification Results

## Summary
This document summarizes the verification process for the local git hook setup in the PromptHub project.

## Initial State
- The project had a pre-push hook configured in `.husky/pre-push`
- The hook was designed to run tests before allowing a push
- The hook was not executable, so it was being ignored by Git

## Verification Process
1. **Examined the current git hook setup**
   - Found a pre-push hook in `.husky/pre-push`
   - The hook runs tests and aborts the push if tests fail

2. **Verified Husky installation**
   - Husky is properly installed as a dev dependency
   - The project has a "prepare" script to install Husky hooks

3. **Created a test file**
   - Created `src/app.service.spec.ts` with tests for the AppService
   - Verified that the tests pass

4. **Tested the pre-push hook with failing tests**
   - Added an intentionally failing test
   - Attempted to push, but the hook was ignored because it wasn't executable
   - Made the hook executable with `chmod +x .husky/pre-push`
   - Attempted to push again, and the hook correctly prevented the push due to failing tests

5. **Tested the pre-push hook with passing tests**
   - Removed the failing test
   - Verified that all tests pass
   - Successfully pushed the changes

## Results
- The pre-push hook is now working correctly
- It prevents pushes when tests fail
- It allows pushes when tests pass

## Changes Made
1. Made the pre-push hook executable with `chmod +x .husky/pre-push`
2. Created a test file `src/app.service.spec.ts` with tests for the AppService

## Recommendations
- Ensure that all git hooks in the `.husky` directory are executable
- Consider adding this check to the project setup documentation
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests to ensure code quality
